How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see 
the bug that was introduced?

I didn't do it but it's nice to know about it.


Key commands:
cd ~                          # change directories to your home 
directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called 
lesson_1_reflections.txt (you can replace subl with another editor 
here if you prefer a different one)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make 
you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It's nice to see where you left off previously. Also, helpful to 
revert to previous edits.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when 
to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Con is that I wait too long before I commit. Pro is that I can 
commit at logical intervals.

Key commands:
git diff <commit id #1> <commit id #2>
git log --stat # which files were changed
git --version

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow 
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google 
Docs, treat each file separately?

So that files that go together can be tracked together.

Getting Colored Output:

To get colored diff output, run git config --global color.ui auto

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the 
history of files?

git log --stat is nice to see lines added and deleted. git diff 
allows for nice comparison between commits.

Key commands:
git checkout <commit id> # revert to previous commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make
changes that could break something?

Version control makes it very easy to revert back to a previous 
commit using checkout.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try
using Git for?

To back-up my code from various projects.

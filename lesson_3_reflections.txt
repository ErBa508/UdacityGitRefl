## Lesson 3 ## Udacity Git and GitHub

Caching your GitHub password in Git
https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/

Commands:
git remote # to view remote repos
git remote add <origin> <url> # if only one remote, name origin, 
supply GitHub url
git remote -v # "verbose" (provides more data)
git push <remote> <local branch> # i.e. git push origin master

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

Remote repository is useful when working from multiple computers. 
Remote also a nice way to back-up work.


## Pull ##

git pull origin master # pull new changes from GitHub


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

Manual pull gives the user more control in deciding when the best
time to pull is, especially if a conflict might occur.

## Clone ##

git clone <url> # clone from remote the repo using github url


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?

Fork is when I want a copy of someone else's repo; clone is when I 
want a copy of my repo, either from remote or from local to local;
and branch is when I want to make a new commit that branches off
of master.

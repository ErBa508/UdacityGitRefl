## Lesson 3 ## Udacity Git and GitHub

Caching your GitHub password in Git

Commands:
git remote # to view remote repos
git remote add <origin> <url> # if only one remote, name origin, 
supply GitHub url
git remote -v # "verbose" (provides more data)
git push <remote> <local branch> # i.e. git push origin master

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

Remote repository is useful when working from multiple computers. 
Remote also a nice way to back-up work.


## Pull ##

git pull origin master # pull new changes from GitHub


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

Manual pull gives the user more control in deciding when the best
time to pull is, especially if a conflict might occur.

## Clone ##

git clone <url> # clone from remote the repo using github url


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?

Fork is when I want a copy of someone else's repo; clone is when I 
want a copy of my repo, either from remote or from local to local;
and branch is when I want to make a new commit that branches off
of master.

## Merging remote changes ##

git branch -a # to view all branches
git fetch origin # instead of git pull; starts new branch and 
allows for git log/diff comparison; for potentially conflicting 
changes
git status # to reveal diverged branch & origin/master
git log origin/master # to reveal commits from remote

option 1:
git pull origin master

option 2:
git fetch origin
git merge master origin/master # which then may report a conflict
git add <merged master file> # add and commit once resolve conflict
git commit # no file name for this one
git push origin master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It is helpful to compare the progress of the local branch relative 
to origin/master when offline.
